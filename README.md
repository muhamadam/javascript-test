# JavaScript Engineering Test Project

This Repo is created solely for an asessment which was to create a simple react application and show Cards information from this Endpoint: 
https://docs.magicthegathering.io/

We divided the Project into Two Parts i.e. Client And Server

## Client Side

Install the dependencies using the command:
```bash
    npm install
```
Run the Project using the command:
```bash
    npm  start
```

Project should be up running on localhost:3000 (Make sure the node server is running so the app is able to fetch the data required)

## Server Side

Install the dependencies using the command:
```bash
    npm install
```
Run the Project using the command:
```bash
    npm  start
```

Project should be up running on localhost:4500

## Packages Used
redux-toolkit used to store state information and update the DOM based on that.

mtgsdk was used to fetch the cards information.

Infinite Scrolling is implemented instead of Button Selection to load more data.
